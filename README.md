Hi! This is just a test so I can learn how to add Auth0 to the main NoStateNode project ...

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
